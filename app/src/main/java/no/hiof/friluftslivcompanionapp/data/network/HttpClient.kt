/**
 * A Singleton object `HttpClient` that holds an instance of OkHttpClient.
 * OkHttpClient is designed to be shared across the application, and itâ€™s efficient to share an instance
 * to use for all HTTP calls. This is because the shared instance will keep track of all ongoing requests
 * and reuse connections and threads, reducing latency and memory usage.
 *
 * The instance of OkHttpClient in this object is configured with an interceptor that adds the eBird API key
 * to all outgoing requests. This is necessary for making authenticated requests to the eBird API.
